# Product Context: FitPlate

## Why This Project Exists
FitPlate addresses the growing demand for convenient, healthy meal solutions. Many people struggle to maintain a balanced diet due to time constraints, lack of cooking skills, or difficulty calculating nutritional requirements. FitPlate solves this by providing pre-prepared, personalized meals delivered directly to customers.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Nutritional Planning Complexity**: Users no longer need to calculate calories, macros, or meal plans manually
2. **Time Constraints**: Busy individuals can access healthy meals without cooking
3. **Dietary Restrictions**: Platform accommodates various dietary needs (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
4. **Goal Achievement**: Personalized meal plans aligned with fitness goals (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.)
5. **Operational Management**: Comprehensive admin tools for staff to manage meals, orders, locations, and customers
